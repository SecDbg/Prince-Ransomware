# Prince Ransomware

## Quick Disclaimer
- I genuinely can't see the motivation for using this half-assed Github project in actual ransomware operations.
- Regarding the cybersecurity researchers painting me as a threat actor that actively offers ReFUDs for this to aid threat actors, I didn't ReFUD it once because I wasn't bothered lmao.
- TL;DR: Don't use my shit for operations, don't kick my door down, and send me money.


## Detection Update (15/08/24)
Prince now has a Windows Defender flag, namely "Ransom:Win64/PrinceRansom.YAA!MTB". This means that Prince Ransomware will no longer bypass Windows Defender without modifications to remove the signature.

## Brief Overview
Prince is a ransomware written from scratch in Go. It uses a mixture of ChaCha20 and ECIES cryptography in order to encrypt files securely so that they cannot be recovered by traditional recovery tools. Files which have been encrypted by Prince can only be decrypted using the corresponding decryptor.

## Installation & Setup
### Pre-requisites:
- [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev)

### Compiling the Builder
- In order to compile the builder program, you must run the `Build.bat` file.
- This will automatically download the dependencies and build the `Builder.exe` file in the current directory.

### Building the Ransomware
- In order to build the encryptor and decryptor, you must run the `Builder.exe` program.
- Ensure that the builder is in the same directory as the `Encryptor` and `Decryptor` directories, as it will not be able to build them otherwise.
- The builder will generate a unique ECIES key pair and output the compiled executables to the current directory.
- The `Prince-Built.exe` file is the encryptor. Use caution when handling it as it can cause a lot of damage to your system.
- The `Decryptor-Built.exe` file is the decryptor. It will only decrypt files which were decrypted by the corresponding encryptor.

## Encryption Process
- The encryptor enumerates all drives on the system, and proceeds to iterate through each directory recursively.
- It ignores blacklisted files, directories and extensions.
- It generates a unique ChaCha20 key and nonce for each file, and encrypts the file using a pattern of 1 byte encrypted, 2 bytes unencrypted.
- It encrypts the ChaCha20 key and nonce using the ECIES public key, and prepends them to the start of the file.

## Benefits of ChaCha20 and ECIES
I chose this unique combination of encryption methods for several reasons:
- ChaCha20's stream-based approach allows for byte-by-byte encryption, enabling the pattern of 1 byte encrypted, 2 bytes unencrypted.
- ECIES offers similar security to RSA with shorter key lengths, making it a more efficient choice.

## Ethical Considerations
Releasing an open-source ransomware tool like Prince on GitHub presents ethical considerations, but it also offers significant benefits, particularly for security researchers:

- Open-source ransomware projects such as Prince can provide researchers with valuable insights into the techniques used by threat actors. This is critical for developing countermeasures and improving cybersecurity practices.

- Open-source ransomware projects such as Prince can provide security professionals with an easy-to-use tool to simulate real-world scenarios in a safe and ethical manner. This can help in identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in existing defenses.

- Open-source ransomware projects such as Prince can promote collaboration within the cybersecurity community. Researchers can share their findings, and collectively work towards developer more robust defenses against threat actors utilising ransomware.
